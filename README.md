# Vital-Mail

## Set-Up

See the respective files for instructions on how to run the backend and frontend.

The frontend requires the backend to be running in order to operate.

## Overview

Vital Mail is a messaging platform modeled after email systems built using Vite and Express with NodeJS.

## Features

### Account Creation and Login

Vital Mail requires an account login to utilize its features.

Clicking the "Register an Account" on the login page directs you to the register form.

Accounts require a unique address and a password for creation.

Once logged in, clicking Log Out in the navigation menu will clear your login token.

### Mailbox View

Vital Mail gives you a standard view of all of your mail in each mailbox from the home page.  By 
clicking on another mailbox in the navigation menu, you can switch what mailbox you are viewing.

The mailbox displays mail by date from most recently received to most distant.

### Viewing Messages

While viewing a mailbox, clicking on any entry in the table will open a view of the message's full contents.

### Sending Messages

By clicking compose in the navigation bar, a message can be sent to another user. To send a message, a subject 
and valid recipient must be included.  No content is required for a successful message.
